# Try Cursor CLI (i.e. cursor-agent(1))

## Project Goals
Understand how cursor(1) and cursor-agent(1) can work together to create a complete development workflow for web application projects.

## Project Setup

### Installing cursor-agent
```bash
# Install cursor-agent globally
npm install -g @cursor/agent

# Or install locally in project
npm install @cursor/agent

# Verify installation
cursor-agent --version
```

### Original Website Reference
- **Source Website:** https://www.upsoilandsoul.com/
- **Project Goal:** Complete rewrite of the Upsoil & Soul Farm & Campground website

## Running & Installing Project

### Running the Website Locally

#### Development Server
```bash
# Navigate to the Next.js project directory
cd upsoil-soul-nextjs

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

#### Access the Website
- **Local Development:** http://localhost:3000
- **Alternative Port:** http://localhost:3001 (if port 3000 is in use)
- **Network Access:** http://192.168.1.144:3000 (accessible from other devices on your network)

#### Debugging the Site
```bash
# Check if the server is running
curl -I http://localhost:3000

# View development logs
# The terminal will show compilation status and any errors

# Hot reloading is enabled - changes to files will automatically refresh the browser
```

#### Production Build (Optional)
```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Technology Stacks

#### Original Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with Flexbox/Grid, Google Fonts (Inter)
- **Icons:** Font Awesome 6.0.0
- **Images:** Unsplash CDN
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first design with media queries
- **Performance:** Lazy loading, intersection observers, optimized animations

#### Target Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Fonts:** Inter font family via Google Fonts
- **Images:** Next.js Image optimization + Unsplash integration
- **Deployment:** Vercel-ready with static generation
- **Performance:** Built-in optimizations, code splitting, and Core Web Vitals

##### Improvements
**For Developers:**
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript catches errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs
- **Component Architecture:** Reusable React components improve code organization
- **Hot Reloading:** Instant feedback during development with Next.js dev server
- **Built-in Tooling:** ESLint, TypeScript, and build optimizations out of the box
- **Modern Development:** Latest React patterns, hooks, and best practices

**For Human Users:**
- **Faster Loading:** Static generation and image optimization improve page speed
- **Better SEO:** Server-side rendering improves search engine visibility
- **Mobile Experience:** Responsive design with Tailwind's mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility:** Better semantic HTML and ARIA support
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it

**For Business/Operations:**
- **Deployment:** One-click deployment to Vercel with automatic builds
- **Scalability:** Static generation handles high traffic efficiently
- **Maintenance:** Component-based architecture makes updates easier
- **Performance:** Core Web Vitals optimization improves user experience metrics
- **Cost Efficiency:** Static hosting is more cost-effective than server-side rendering
